# Light-Servo
LightServo is an Arduino-based project that uses a photoresistor to control a servo motor based on light intensity. The original version adjusts the servo position (0–180°) according to light levels. The improved version adds an LED to model a street light, turning off in bright conditions and shining brightest in darkness.
